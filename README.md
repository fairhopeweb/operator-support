# Operator

### This repository is the spot to report bugs or submit feature requests.

Operator is an autonomous red team C2 platform, built by [Prelude](https://prelude.org). It is designed for red, purple and blue teamers to conduct realistic threat assessments. Using the desktop application, you can deploy agents on remote computers and launch custom adversary profiles against them to identify the holes that antivirus programs & vulnerability scanners are not designed to locate.

You can download the latest copy of the application [here](https://www.prelude.org/download/current), for either MacOS, Windows or Linux.

> Did you know that the team at Prelude runs free red team training programs as part of our open-source outreach? We teach IT/InfoSec/DevOps/defenders/software engineers how to red team, so they can apply practical techniques to their day jobs. Check out the [Pink Badge](https://www.prelude.org/training/pinkbadge) for more details.

## Community bucket

When you start Operator, your app loads in our [community bucket](https://github.com/preludeorg/community-bucket) in order to populate your environment with hundreds of open-source TTPs, payloads, agents, tools, training modules and more. We encourage contributions, so if you'd like to add TTPs for other Operator members, publish your own agents or come up with a new training flag for any of the programs - submit a pull request!

## Resources 

The Prelude development & security teams run several supporting resources for the community:

- A [quick start guide](docs/quickstart.md) to get Operator running with a single Pneuma agent.
- A [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NWURE99JzE) to interact with the team.
- A [YouTube video library](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZyx-PDZ_k7Vuzyqr4-qK9A) containing tutorials and use-cases.
- A [blog](https://feed.prelude.org), where we post on general security and specific Operator topics.
