# Translators

Translators are simple servers that accept beacons over various network protocols and translate them into one of the 
protocols Operator accepts, proxying the data along the way. 

Translators provide the following benefits:

- Write Operator agents in any language and against any network protocol
- Hide your Operator instance and redirectors behind deployed translator servers
